My name is César Román, I graduated from [CETYS Universidad](https://www.cetys.mx/campus-mexicali/){:target="_blank"} with a B.S. in Computer Science back in December 2004, and I've been writing lines of code since the '90s, and professionally since 2005. Telecommuting since December 2012.

I have a passion for technology, software development, database design, music, and writing. So you might find posts related to these and more subjects.

I will write in English, pero también se habla español.

### Background

I've been exposed to computers and coding since an early age, some may say, with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC){:target="_blank"} back in 1991-1992, [Turbo Pascal 7.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal#Version_7.0){:target="_blank"} between 1999 and 2000, [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B){:target="_blank"}, [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language){:target="_blank"}, and introduction to [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript){:target="_blank"} and [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)){:target="_blank"} between 2000 and 2004, [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)){:target="_blank"} between 2003 and 2004, [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP){:target="_blank"} in 2005, [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)){:target="_blank"} (mainly [ASP.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET){:target="_blank"}, but also a brief period with [WPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation){:target="_blank"}) between 2005 and 2014, and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)){:target="_blank"} and its implementation [Jython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython){:target="_blank"} from 2015 to date.
