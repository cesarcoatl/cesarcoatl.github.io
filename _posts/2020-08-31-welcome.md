In the past, I've delved in the blogging universe using Blogger, Tumblr, and even WordPress, but after a while, I fell disenchanted with what they offered.

I learned about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} back in 2013 via the one and only [Phil Haack](https://twitter.com/haacked){:target="_blank"} ([Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Haack](https://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/02/dr-jekyll-and-mr-haack/){:target="_blank"}), and now it is that I take the plunge and start experimenting myself.

So here is a guide on how I got myself started using GitHub pages.

### Assumptions

You are already familiar with GitHub and Git and know your way around the command line.

Let's get started!

### Getting started with GitHub pages

There's a very comprehensive guide on how to get started with GitHub pages [here](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/){:target="_blank"} or [over here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages){:target="_blank"}, but if you would like to create your posts locally, after you've created your repo, clone it on your computer, and continue with this guide.

### Getting rbenv set up on macOS

You might know that macOS comes with `ruby` and `python`, but considering using them for your personal projects and messing with them is **not recommended**.

So this is where [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"} comes in and saves the day. And the [Jekyll on macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/){:target="_blank"} is a great step-by-step guide on how to set up Xcode, Homebrew, and rbenv on your macOS machine.

Just follow these steps:

1. Install Command Line Tools for Xcode ([link](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=xcode){:target="_blank"})
1. Install Homebrew

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
    ```

1. Install rbenv

    ```bash
    brew install rbenv
    ```

1. Set up rbenv integration with your shell

    ```bash
    rbenv init
    ```

1. Add it to your bash profile

    ```bash
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

1. Restart your shell so the path changes take effect

    ```bash
    exec "$SHELL"
    ```

1. Check your rbenv installation

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
    ```

### Installing a ruby version and setting a global version with rbenv

1. If you wish to list stable versions, use the `--list` option, or `--list-all` and pipe the results to `grep` to search for a particular version

    ```bash
    $ rbenv install --list-all | grep "2\.7\."
    2.7.0-dev
    2.7.0-preview1
    2.7.0-preview2
    2.7.0-preview3
    2.7.0-rc1
    2.7.0-rc2
    2.7.0
    2.7.1
    2.7.2
    2.7.3
    2.7.4
    jruby-9.2.7.0
    ```

1. Install the latest compatible version with GitHub Pages

    ```bash
    rbenv install 2.7.3
    ```

1. Once installed, list all versions

    ```bash
    rbenv versions
    ```

1. Select your desired version

    ```bash
    rbenv global 2.7.3
    rbenv rehash
    ```

And you're all set!

### Getting Jekyll on macOS

After installing Xcode and Ruby, let's go straight to installing Jekyll.

To install everything you need, and be compliant with `gem` versions used by GitHub Pages (found [here](https://pages.github.com/versions/){:target="_blank"}), simply run the following command:

```bash
gem install github-pages
```

Now that we're ready, let's find a theme!

### Finding a Jekyll theme

While you may use the options provided by GitHub, I found [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll){:target="_blank"} over at [JAMstack themes](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/){:target="_blank"}.

The instructions are straightforward; found [here](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/README.md){:target="_blank"}.

Once you get it set up, open a Terminal session in your blog's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
bundle install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies and get you one step closer.

### Editing and testing your Jekyll blog on your local machine

I am using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} for editing my site, but you may use another text editor or IDE out there.

And after some customization I just run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

![vscode]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/vscode.png)

And my site is now live at <http://127.0.0.1:4000/>

And this is the final product:

![screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/screenshot.png)

### Publishing your site and all future posts

With the power of `commit` and `push` you can accomplish anything.

### Extras
