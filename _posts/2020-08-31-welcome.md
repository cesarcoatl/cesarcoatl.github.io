In the past, I've delved in the blogging universe using Blogger, Tumblr, and even WordPress, but after a while, I fell disenchanted with what they offered.

I learned about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} back in 2013 via the one and only [Phil Haack](https://twitter.com/haacked){:target="_blank"} ([Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Haack](https://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/02/dr-jekyll-and-mr-haack/){:target="_blank"}), and now it is that I take the plunge and start experimenting myself.

So here is a guide on how I got myself started using GitHub pages.

### 1. Assumptions

You are already familiar with GitHub and Git and know your way around the command line.

Let's get started!

### 2. Getting started with GitHub pages

There's a very comprehensive guide on how to get started with GitHub pages [here](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/){:target="_blank"} or [over here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages){:target="_blank"}, but if you would like to create your posts locally, after you've created your repo, clone it on your computer, and continue with this guide.

### 3. Getting rbenv set up on macOS

You might know that macOS comes with `ruby` and `python`, but considering using them for your personal projects and messing with them is **not recommended**.

So this is where [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"} comes in and saves the day. And the [Jekyll on macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/){:target="_blank"} is a great step-by-step guide on how to set up Xcode, Homebrew, and rbenv on your macOS machine.

Just follow these steps:
```bash
# Install Xcode
xcode-select --install

# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# Install rbenv
brew install rbenv

# Set up rbenv integration with your shell
rbenv init

# Alternatively run this
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Check your rbenv installation:
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
```

And you're all set!

### 4. Getting Jekyll on macOS

After installing Xcode and Ruby, let's go straight to installing Jekyll.

{: .box-note}
As of this writing, the latest version for Jekyll is  4.1.1, which is not yet supported by GitHub Pages (check [here](https://pages.github.com/versions/){:target="_blank"} for up-to-date dependencies), that's why we specify version `3.9.0`.

To Install Jekyll we need to run the following commands:

```bash
gem install bundler
gem install jekyll -v 3.9.0
```

To verify, run the following commands:

```bash
$ which jekyll 
/Users/thecesrom/.rbenv/shims/jekyll
$ jekyll -v
jekyll 3.9.0
```

Now that we're ready, let's find a theme!

### 5. Finding a Jekyll theme

While you may use the options provided by GitHub, I found [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll){:target="_blank"} over at [JAMstack themes](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/){:target="_blank"}.

The instructions are straightforward; found [here](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/README.md){:target="_blank"}.

Once you get it set up, open a Terminal session in your blog's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
bundle install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies and get you one step closer.

### 6. Editing and testing your Jekyll blog on your local machine

I am using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} for editing my site, but you may use another text editor or IDE out there.

To use the correct Jekyll version, I just changed line 20 on `beautiful-jekyll-theme.gemspec` to:

```ruby
 spec.add_runtime_dependency "jekyll", "~> 3.9"
```

And after some customization I just run:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

![vscode]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/vscode.png)

And my site is now live at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

And this is the final product:

### 7. Publishing your site and all future posts

With the power of `commit` and `push` you can accomplish anything.

### 8. Extras
