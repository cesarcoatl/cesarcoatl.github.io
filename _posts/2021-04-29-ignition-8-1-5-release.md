## New in 8.1.5

### Scripting Functions

- Added [system.perspective.navigateForward](https://docs.inductiveautomation.com/display/DOC81/system.perspective.navigateForward){:target="_blank"} and [system.perspective.navigateBack](https://docs.inductiveautomation.com/display/DOC81/system.perspective.navigateBack){:target="_blank"} scripting methods, which operate similar to a browsers forward and back functions.
- The [system.perspective.navigate](https://docs.inductiveautomation.com/display/DOC81/system.perspective.navigate){:target="_blank"} function now has a newTab parameter, which opens contents in a new tab.

Additionally I'd like to announce the release of [Ignition 8.1.5](https://github.com/thecesrom/Ignition/releases/tag/v8.1.5){:target="_blank"}, and [Ignition 8.1.5-jython](https://github.com/thecesrom/Ignition/releases/tag/v8.1.5-jython){:target="_blank"} for the [Ignition](https://github.com/thecesrom/Ignition){:target="_blank"} GitHub repo.

Feel free to clone it, fork it, or simply download the source.

Happy coding!
