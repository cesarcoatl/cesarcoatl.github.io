### Introduction

I've been using GitHub for the past couple of years, but it was not until last year that my contribution activity increased. Some PRs [here](https://github.com/justinlettau/sql-source-control/pull/133) and some others [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Athecesrom) and [there](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Athecesrom).

I have created [an organization](https://github.com/coatl-dev), started [sponsoring](https://github.com/thecesrom?tab=sponsoring), and switched from HTTP to SSH following [this useful guide](https://docs.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/).

But yesterday a user's commit `Verified` label caught my attention, so I decided to grab a cup of coffee and learn about [managing commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/articles/generating-a-gpg-key/), and after following all the necessary steps I was able to generate my GPG key and upload it to GitHub, but there was an issue, which is the main topic of this post.

### The problem

At the [Signing commits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits) step I was about to sign my first commit but then tragedy struck.

```bash
$ git commit -S -m "First signed commit"
error: gpg failed to sign the data
fatal: failed to write commit object
```

I was not sure what was going, so I retraced my steps, and I even found [some](https://github.com/pstadler/keybase-gpg-github#troubleshooting-gpg-failed-to-sign-the-data) [possible](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41054093) solutions, but none of them worked. And I even deleted my keys, and started again but then, similar to this [user's symptoms](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/571597/gpg-key-gen-fails-no-such-file-or-directory), I got the following:

```bash
$ gpg --full-generate-key
...
gpg: agent_genkey failed: No such file or directory
Key generation failed: No such file or directory
```

What is this? Let's see what `$GPG_TTY` has to say:

```bash
$ echo $GPG_TTY
not a tty
```

What? That doesn't make sense! â€“ I thought to myself.

But finally, I saw the light.

### The solution

I found [this great guide](https://eriksamuelsson.com/sign-git-commits-on-github-with-gpg-in-macos/) on how to set up GPG, and some useful [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae, courtesy of [Erik Samuelsson](https://github.com/samuelsson).

But all of the guides that I found did not take into account my current setup; I am using [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) by [Roman Perepelitsa](https://github.com/romkatv/), and he had [the answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/608921) to my problem.

>tty command requires that stdin is attached to a terminal. When using Powerlevel10k, stdin is redirected from /dev/null when Instant Prompt is activated and until Zsh is fully initialized. This is explained in more detail in Powerlevel10k FAQ.

The latter version will work anywhere and it's over 1000 times faster. TTY is a special parameter set by Zsh very early during initialization. It gives you access to the terminal even when stdin might be redirected.

So there it was. Instead of `GPG_TTY=$(tty)` somewhere in my `.zshrc`, all I needed was `GPG_TTY=$TTY`.

```bash
$ exec "$SHELL"
$ echo $GPG_TTY
/dev/ttys000
```

And ever since, all my commits are signed by updating my `git` settings:

```bash
git config --global user.signiningkey XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

And after installing `pinentry-mac`, I don't have to enter my passphrase every single time.

```bash
echo 'pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac' >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
killall gpg-agent
```

And done!

Hope this helps.
